Created using WebXR & WebXR Geospatial Anchors API. Developed by Shane Tully.

Awarded First Class Honours (1.1) for project.

## Overview
A mobile website that allows the user to view augmented reality scenes via their browser. More advanced versions of the application will allow the user to create said scenes via the same browser page. Presently, the augmented reality scenes are read from a simple relational database, as they can be created from plaintext by the database admin.
